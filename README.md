# Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Solutions
This project is a part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In this project, we worked with real-life data provided to us by Bertelsmann AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. The job was to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.

We are not allowed to publish the data provided by Arvato Financial Services due to the terms and conditions. In the notebook you can find the code and the analysis that I perfomed on the datasets.
